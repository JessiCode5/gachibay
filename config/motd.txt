<b>Rules:</b>
1. No Murderbone. All kills must have a valid reasoning behind them. Self defense, or an argument turned violent are all correct. If you join the server and the first thing you do is attack someone, or come up to a person and vaguely implicate them with some crime and attack them, you're gonna get beaned.
<br>
2. All those holding jobs must perform their duties. Arbiters must seek out heretics and hold trials, Pacekeepers must keep the peace. Rogue station security is not an excuse to murderbone. Picking magistrate for his claymore in order to revenge kill is dumb and we will we will rock you for it.
<br>
3. Wanton station destruction. Repeatedly destroying the station on purpose is dumb, and if you've been told to read rule 3 after hitting the SM emitter without even attempting to set it up, you're probably a jackass.
